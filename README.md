# node-assignment
Create a tiny API that uses Express in Node.js to expose an endpoint that takes an rss url, parses it and returns a list of episodes from that rss feed. Should be REST (-ish). Any parse errors that are returned by the parsing module you choose, should propagate in a nice way to the client.
